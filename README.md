# Cursed Nintendo

## 💀 About 💀

Welcome to **Cursed Nintendo**, a project dedicated to exploring the unsettling, bizarre, and downright cursed aspects of Nintendo's beloved franchises. This isn't about glitches or speedruns; it's about the moments that make you question reality, the uncanny valley of character designs, and the dark corners of otherwise wholesome games.

Prepare to have your childhood memories slightly (or severely) tainted.
